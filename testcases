mitgations:	PIE, Stack Canary, RELRO, NX
0.) Overflow Vars
1	-	Basic Test
1	-	Overwrite  Three Vars, two equal, one not equal
1	-	Overwrite Var, with var past where you can write
1	- 	Overwrtite six vars, one equal, one not equal, one less than, one greater than, one less than or equal to, one greater than or equal to
1	-	Repeated Cmps against single variable
1	-	More Repeated Cmps against single variable
1	-	Nested cmps

	-	multiple inputs not tied to a bug, but are critical
	-	argv
	-	pie printf infoleak

mitgations:	RELRO, NX
1.) Call Func

1	-	Basic Test
1	-	Basic Test of Import System
1	-	Overflow with one var, call func
1	-	Overflow with three vars, call func
1	-	Baic test with multiple win funcs
1	-	Baic test with multiple false win funcs, one win func

	-	multiple inputs not tied to a bug, but are critical

mitgations:	RELRO, PIE
2.) Call Shellcode
1	- 	Basic Test
1	-	Basic test with scanf
	-	Have to place shellcode ahead of stack variable
	- 	Have to place shellcode between two stack variables
	-	Have to place shellcode after return address
	-	Have to place shellcode in place of variables with cmps against them


	-	dynamic analyzer, stack infoleak from different function

	-	multiple inputs not tied to a bug, but are critical
	-	argv


mitigations: Stack Canary, RELRO, NX
3.) Call Indirect
1	-	Basic test
1	-	Indirect ptr on stack is compared
1	-	cmp to get to indirect ptr
1	-	Mutliple indirect ptrs
1	-	Multiple indirect ptrs, compares to get to them, and cmps against indirect ptrs
1	-	multiple false win funcs, one real win func


	-	multiple inputs not tied to a bug, but are critical
	-	argv input
	-	pie printf infoleak
	-	libc printf infoleak
